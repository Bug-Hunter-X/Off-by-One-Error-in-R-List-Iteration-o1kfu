# R Off-by-One Error
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in R when iterating through lists.  The example code attempts to access list elements using a loop with indices starting from 0.  R uses 1-based indexing, resulting in an error.
The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate through a list using a for loop in R, addressing the off-by-one error.
